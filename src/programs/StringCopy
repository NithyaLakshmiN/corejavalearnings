//StringBuffer is a peer class of String 
//that provides much of the functionality of strings. 
   //String represents fixed-length, immutable character sequences while StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequences.

//StringBuffer may have characters and substrings 
     // inserted in the middle or appended to the end. 
     // It will automatically grow to make room for such 
     // additions and often has more characters preallocated 
     // than are actually needed, to allow room for growth.
