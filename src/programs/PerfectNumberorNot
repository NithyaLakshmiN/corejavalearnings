/*A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum
of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive
divisors excluding the number itself. Equivalently, a perfect number
is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors.
The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2 and 3 are its proper
positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6
is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors:
		( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6.*/
